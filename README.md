# New-Student-Information-Application

A new University of Florida information hub and forum, with built in Facebook and Twitter API's, along with a Google Maps navigation page, all requiring a google login to access. This web application provides key information for all UF students such as, student resources, key websites, clubs and events, and a UF map. Due to covid, many new students have had a tough time adjusting to UF and finding the information they need so our application will serve as a hub of information for them.
